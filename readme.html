        <h2>Explanation of the Asset Configuration Parameters</h2>
        The asset configuration parameters affect 'test connectivity' and some other actions of the application. The parameters related to 'test connectivity' action are listed below
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>base url: </b>Qualys API URL. You can find the API URL for a specific platform <a href="https://www.qualys.com/platform-identification/">here</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>username: </b> The user name (login) of a Qualys user account.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>password: </b> The password of a Qualys user account.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>timeout: </b> The total time available for a request to be processed and answered. The default time is 30 seconds.

        <h2>Explanation of the Qualys Action's Parameters</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Test Connectivity (Action Workflow Details)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> This action will test the connectivity of the Splunk SOAR server to the Qualys instance by making an
                        initial API call using the provided asset configuration parameters. </li>
                    <li> The action validates the provided asset configuration parameters. Based on the API call response, the
                        appropriate success and failure message will be displayed when the action gets executed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Scan Summary</h3>
                This action will identify hosts that were not scanned and why.<br>
                Permissions - 'Manager' role is required.<br>
                Categories for hosts not scanned:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Excluded</b> - The hosts were excluded. Hosts may be excluded on a per scan basis (by the
                        user launching or scheduling the scan) or globally for all scans. Managers and Unit
                        Managers have privileges to edit the global excluded hosts list for the subscription.</li>
                    <li> <b>Dead</b> - The hosts were not “alive” at the time of the scan</li>
                    <li> <b>Cancelled</b> - Hosts were not scanned because the scan was cancelled. Scans may be
                        cancelled by a user, by an administrator or automatically by the service as specified in
                        scheduled scan settings.</li>
                    <li> <b>Unresolved</b> - Hosts were scanned but they could not be reported</li>
                    <li> <b>Aborted</b> - The scan was abruptly discontinued. This is a rare occurrence that may be
                        caused for different reasons. For example, it's possible that a connection timed out or
                        there were connection errors on a particular port or the scan time elapsed.</li>
                    <li> <b>Blocked</b> - Hosts were blocked from scanning for some reason. For example, user-provided
                        blacklisted IPs to scan and after the scan was launched it was blocked due to improper
                        configuration.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Launch Scan</h3>
                This action will launch a vulnerability scan in the user's account.
